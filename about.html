                        <h1>The 1975 used to call Drive Like I Do</h1>
                        <p>
                            The band underwent several monikers before settling on their current guise. They formed in 2002, and 
                            went through band names like a vinyl collector flicking through record shop shelves. Alongside Drive Like I Do(DLID),
                            they used to go by the names Me and You Versus Them, Forever Enjoying Sex, Talkhouse, The Slowdown and Bigsleep.
                            DLID specialise in emo-rinsed pop,Under Drive Like I Do, the band performed covers of Fall Out Boy and put out tracks like ‘Lost Boys’. 
                            Until now, these rare recordings have been kept fairly under wraps, listened to by diehard fans who’ve followed the band for the past decade.

                        <h1>The 1975 origins</h1>
                        <p>
                            Matthew Healy (son of Denise Welch and Tim Healy), Ross MacDonald, Adam Hann and George Daniel met at Wilmslow High School 
                            near Manchester as teenagers and began to play music in 2002.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "There was this idealistic hippy council worker who started to put on these gigs for kids, to form bands. 
                            I remember the guitarist Adam Hann came up to me and said he wanted to play one of these shows. We started playing, 
                            doing covers of punk songs and pop songs and just started out doing that. Then once we eventually wrote a song, I decided, well, 
                            this is a lot better than going to work – or going to school, for that matter. We started from then and we’ve been making music 
                            together since we were about 15 – George was 14, actually, when we started." - Healy
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After Hann invited the members to form a band, they passed their early days covering punk songs in a local club. Healy was originally the
                            drummer, but took over vocals after the previous singer left to start another band. Daniel was recruited as the new drummer to complete 
                            the final line-up.
                        </p>
                           
                        <p>
                            "I met an artist on Holiday. It sounds a bit more bohemian, idealistic than maybe it was but I met him and ended up leaving with a book that 
                            must of been treated almost like a diary by a previous owner, so when I read it there was all these mad scribblings and notes, and the person 
                            had dated it "the 1st of June The 1975". Then when it came to naming the band it just seemed like quite an appropriate title, you know." - Healy
                            The band first appeared as The 1975 in January 2012, in the run up to the release of their first EP and after signing to UK based Indie label Dirty Hit.
                            They performed as The 1975 for the first time in February as a support act for General Fiasco on their nationwide tour.

                        <h1>The 1975 music genre</h1>
                        <p>
                            The 1975 has garnered acclaim for their exploration of an eclectic range of genres such as pop rock, 
                            synth-pop, R&B, funk rock, electropop, forms of electronic music (such as UK Garage, 2-step and ambient), 
                            and forms of rock music (such as shoegaze, post-punk and post-rock), as well as elements of jazz, soul and gospel.
                            Frontman Matty Healy's energetic and eccentric stage presence has also garnered acclaim, as has his lyricism 
                            due to its deeply personal, self-aware, self-deprecating, and often observational nature; his lyrical analyses 
                            of politics, society and culture have been praised, notable in songs such as "Love It If We Made It", 
                            "Loving Someone", "Sincerity Is Scary", and "People".
