# The 1975 Fanpage

For this project,I decide to make a !975 band fan page website. In this website, there will be photos and footages taken from the internet to let the audience visit the website know more about them,their music style and their albums.

## Design Process
The purpose of this website is to promote the 1975 band to the audience.This website includes photos and footages of the band to allow the reader to know how the band overview and style is. 

For the website, I create a responsive navigation bar for user to click into other pages, when the screen is smaller, the menu will be minimise and show a burger at the top right,this is to save space as it look neater in the screen and is still easily assesscible to other page.

I also create a footer with links to the band social media for more information if the user are interest to find out more about them. Additionally, there is contact me link for user to contact me if they want to.

For the home page, I place an background video which edits of the video were done by me to create an impression to the user that visit the website

For the about page, i create image slider as it look neater and save more space in the website, additionally, it is responsive and seems professionally.


For the layout of the website, I used Adobe XD to do my template to give me an idea of how my website look like. 
The link below is my template i made using Adobe XD:

## Features
These are the features i created in the website:

* For the website, I create a responsive navigation bar for user to click into other pages, when the screen is smaller, the menu will be minimise and show a burger at the top right,when user press the burger, an animation of the menu will slide in from the right side of screen and the page title too.

* I also create a footer with links to the band social media for more information, I use icon to represent the type of social media link to the bands, when user press on to it, a new page will open that goes into the chosen link. Additionally, there is contact me link which will be bring user to the contact me page to fill in the information and question to me with the submit button there.

* For the home page, I place an background video which will autoplay the whole time and is muted

* For the about page, I create image slider that consist of 4 images/videos  per section with the manual button for user to change the image.When the image changes, there will be a swipe to left transition.

* For the video page, it shows the live concert of 1975 band film in london during 2016

* For the album page, it shows the song lists that are in for each album shown in the webs
* For the merchandise page, it is a link that bring user to the actual store website in a new tab

* For the tour page, it is a link that bring user to the actual website in a new tab

* For the contact me page, I create form for user that want to contact me and there will be validation of email address to prevent the wrong format of email submited by the user

### In the future, features that I may add inside:
* A documatry video about the 1975 band 
* A page with pop up images or a better animation with css and javascript

# Technologies Used
