# The 1975 Fanpage

For this project,I decide to make a !975 band fan page website. In this website, there will be photos and footages taken from the internet to let the audience visit the website know more about them,their music style and their albums.

## Design Process
The purpose of this website is to promote the 1975 band to the audience.This website includes photos and footages of the band to allow the reader to know how the band overview and style is. 

For the website, I create a responsive navigation bar for user to click into other pages, when the screen is smaller, the menu will be minimise and show a burger at the top right,this is to save space as it look neater in the screen and is still easily assesscible to other page.

I also create a footer with link to the band social media for more information if the user one. Additionally, there is contact me link for user to contact me if they want to.

For the home page, I place an background video to create an impression to the user that visit the website

For the about page, i create image slider as it look neater and save more space in the website, additionally, it is responsive and seems professionally.


For the layout of the website, I used Adobe XD to do my template to give me an idea of how my website look like.
